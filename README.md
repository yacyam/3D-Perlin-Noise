# 3D Perlin Noise Generator
<i>Final Project for CS3110</i>

Our project is an interactive 3D Perlin Noise generator. It displays
  on the screen a three-dimensional terrain in which the user can view
  from many different angles. As the user, you can color the noise to
  look like rivers and mountains, or even like a volcano, and can create
  your own noise by drawing on the screen or inputting a seed value. This
  project also offers visually stunning ways of mutating the noise in 
  real-time, simulating changes in environments.
